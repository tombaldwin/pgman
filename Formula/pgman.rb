# Homebrew formula for pgman — k9s-style Postgres TUI for Java/AWS shops.
#
# This in-repo copy is for `brew install --formula ./Formula/pgman.rb`
# (local-checkout install). The canonical user-facing install path will
# be the tap at https://github.com/tombaldwin/homebrew-tap:
#   brew tap tombaldwin/tap
#   brew install pgman
#
# After each release: run `scripts/update-formula.sh v<X.Y.Z>` — it
# computes SHA-256s from the GitHub Release tarballs and writes both this
# file and the tap's Formula/pgman.rb in one go, creating the tap entry if
# it doesn't exist yet.
