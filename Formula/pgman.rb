# Homebrew formula for pgman — k9s-style Postgres TUI for Java/AWS shops.
#
# This in-repo copy is for `brew install --formula ./Formula/pgman.rb`
# (local-checkout install). The canonical user-facing install path will
# be the tap at https://github.com/tombaldwin/homebrew-tap:
#   brew tap tombaldwin/tap
#   brew install pgman
#
# pgman has not had a first release yet, so every sha256 below is the
# placeholder `0000…0000`. Cutting v0.2.0 (the first release): run
# `scripts/update-formula.sh v0.2.0` — it computes SHA-256s from the
# GitHub Release tarballs and writes both this file and the tap's
# Formula/pgman.rb in one go, creating the tap entry if it doesn't
# exist yet.
